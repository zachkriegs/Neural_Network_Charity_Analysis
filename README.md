# AlphabetSoup Learning Model
## Overview
- The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether a charity was worth donating to based on the success and failures of past charities the company has donated to.
## Results
- The variables that were considered for this model were the Application_Type variable and the Is_Successful variable from the dataset. The Application_Type variable was considered to be the feature. The Other variable should be removed as it is not a target or feature. 
## Summary 
- The model was 0% accurate in determining whether or not an application would be successful or not. I think a Logistic Regression model would be more appropriate for the classification problem of this model.
